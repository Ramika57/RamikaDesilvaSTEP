                This year had defintely been a wild rollercoster full of events and I was proud of myself
                that I got through it. I had achieved many goals and learnt many things. Here were my goals:
                <br><br>
                In English, my main goal was to contribute more ideas in class discussions. I believe that I 
                had achieved this goal since I contribute at least one idea everytime we had class. It was hard for 
                me to unmute and physically talk therefore I improvised and used the chatbox in the Google Meet. After
                I had done this, I found it very convenient as I learned to contribute my ideas even if they weren't the best.
                <br><br>
                In Maths, my main goal was to improve in my section C work. In order to achieve this goal, I studied for every test and 
                revised/looked back at all my resources. After I did this, the results showed that I had improved so much 
                compared to last year. I was proud of myself as I could see a clear result of my hard work and determination. In the future, 
                I want to work on my participation skills as I tend not to contribute to discussions as much.
                <br><br>
                In Science, I had learned so much and improved so much from last year. I found it hardest to manage the work load in this subject 
                as there was many tasks that were given that were expected to be done in a short period of time. My main goal for this subject was to 
                do well in my practical reports and experiments. To help me, I decided to do additional research about things which led me into several 
                new and interesting concepts, ideas and information. This helped me a lot and I could see improvements as I averaged from 95% - 100% on 
                every practical report.
                <br><br>
                This year had certainly been a wild rollercoster of unexpected events. It was easy at times but at other times it was harder. However, from this 
                experienced, I created new relationships with friends, developed new lifelong skills and learned so much new things. In addition to this, I had a selective 
                schools examination which was held in November this year. Late this year, it became very stressful and hard to manage however this soon evened out 
                after I did this exam. This year had been so much fun and if I could repeat it, I would definitely have many things to change.
