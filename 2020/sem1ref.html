            <p>This semester was an impotant semester as there were so much events that were happening 
                and unfolding. The Covid-19 outbreak had been the first ever global pandemic in a long time and it 
                was interesting how things had to be changed around this. Also, part of this semester was remote learning 
                which was a completely new experience for me and everyone. 
                <br><br>
                In Maths, I found it was easy to manage and stayed ontop of all my tasks. I managed to stay organised and 
                my academic scores were averaging high A's and A+'s. I found this was the easiest subject for me as most of the 
                topics I learnt, I had previous knowledge of.
                <br><br>
                In English, I found it very easy it cope with everything and handle every one of my tasks. I was very organised and 
                I knew what to do, how and where to do it. My teacher was also a very nice teacher which lead to me being less stressed 
                with everything.
                <br><br>
                In Science, I learned new concepts and information as it was a whole new curriculum. I found it easy to complete my practical 
                reports as I had many experience from last year. I averaged around 100% for most of my tasks and assignments. The experiments 
                were completely different from last year as there were more concepts involved and new information we learned throughout the term. 
                <br><br>
                Overall, the semester was amazing and certainly one that I would remember. It taught me so much things and new skills that I 
                developed aswell.
