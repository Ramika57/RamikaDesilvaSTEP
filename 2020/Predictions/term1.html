            <h2>Core<span>|</span></h2>
            <p>In Term 1, I was fully organised and I had no issues with my learning. 
                I was up-to-date with all my classwork and my academic scores had an 
                excellent average. With my effort and participation, I soon realised 
                that I wasn't participating as much in class however I always listened 
                to instructions and information.

            <h2>Electives<span>|</span></h2>
            <p>With my electives, I received an average of very good. In my opinion, 
                I believe that I was doing well in the subjects and was confused to why 
                I didn't recieve excellent. However, it soon came to my realisation that 
                I wasn't participating in classes that often. I kept my academic scores at
                a high average as I studied for every test and did all the homework on time.
