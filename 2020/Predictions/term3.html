            <p>In Term 3, we were faced with online learning again. With this, I was 
                more confident as I knew exactly what to do and how to do it. My English 
                had a consistent very good score. However for Maths, I found that I was not 
                participating in the discussions and wasn't contributing my ideas. I received 
                good for my academic progress and participation. I improved for Science as all my
                very goods got bumped upto excellent.

            <h2>Electives<span>|</span></h2>
            <p>For all my electives, I noticed that they were giving out less excellents than they did before. 
                There were so much factors that were unabled to be determined such as behaviour since many people
                would stay muted for the whole time. In this Term, I found it trickiest to manage things therefore
                my organisation was not the best.
