            <h2>Core<span>|</span></h2>
            <p>In Term 2, I was faced with a new way of life along with my peers
                as we had to undergo remote learning. In the begining, I found it 
                hard to keep up with the work however I soon learned to manage all 
                my workload. In most of my core subjects, I managed to average an excellent
                however I found it hard to manage tasks in science as there was way too many 
                at once. This soon became much easier.

            <h2>Electives<span>|</span></h2>
            <p>With my electives for Term 2, it was no different to Term 1 and I managed to keep
                my very goods and excellents consistent. For some subjects, I found it a little
                tricky to manage the work load in remote learning and hand things in time. However, 
                I managed to become organised with all my subjects.
