                This year in STEP has definitely been a fun one with all my friends, new teachers, new concepts, new information 
                and many more. It has also been very different compared to last year. So much elements were changed from last 
                year such as workload and the things we learnt.
                <br><br>
                This year was certainly more challenging than last year since the curriculum was harder there was a lot more work 
                than compared to last year. There were many more assignments and homework which meant I had to be organised and 
                had to stay ontop of all my work.
                <br><br>
                I excelled in all my classes. I found that doing extra studying helps therefore I did extra study which helped me 
                excel in all my subjects. During semester 1, it was very easy to manage however when it came to Term3, it became difficult. 
                However, I completed extra study and used my free time and this soon paid off as reults show.
                <br><br>
                This year, two of my friends joined STEP. From this, I learnt things from them as they learnt things from me. It was exciting
                to see how the whole year would span out since there were so much differences compared to last year. I used the support from 
                people around me, friends and teachers which was also a factor of my succession throughout the year.
                <br><br>
                Overall, this year in STEP had been such an exciting experience and I can't wait to see what 2021 brings us!
