                This year had definitely been one of the most important years in our lives, especially with remote learning. 
                This new learning experience had definitely been a completely new experience. 
                <br><br>
                In Term 2, I found it easy to manage my tasks. Since I was completely new to this experience, I was completely organised 
                and was ready to overcome any challenge. I treated every one of my tasks with care and dedication. This lead to a good result
                and getting a really good grade for each tasks. I found it easier in remote learning as I got to sleep in more which lead to 
                my performance being really good. I also had no stress with getting things done as I had plently of time in-class and after school.
                <br><br>
                When Term 3 came along, it became very tough to manage most of my tasks as I had a very big exam (Selective High School Exam) which 
                I had to prepare for. This meant I had little time to focus on school which lead to some drops in my academic and organisation. Term 3
                was no different to Term 2 as I had experience and I knew the tips to be ontop of tasks. I managed to be ontop of most of my work which 
                lead to me having a better score in the middle of the Term. As th Term was ending, it was the toughest for me to manage as I found it hard
                to listen to the teacher and organise my work as I was preparing and stressed about my upcoming exam and I couldn't keep up with staying inside 
                for much longer.
                <br><br>
                Overall, this new remote learning experience was a wonderful experience as I had learned so much new skills and creating close bonds with peers. 
                This year will certainly be one everyone will remember for the rest of their lives.
